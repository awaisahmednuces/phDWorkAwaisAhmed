# Big Data Analytics in Healthcare Informatics

My PhD work leverages advanced deep learning frameworks to address critical challenges in medical data analysis, such as data imbalance and inefficient feature representation, across various modalities. Introducing innovative frameworks like ***, OCCNet, ***, MED-Prompt, and *** significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnoses and predictions. These contributions, deeply interconnected, optimize feature selection, rebalance tabular data, class distributions, and modality balancing, and ensure computational efficiency, setting new benchmarks in AI-driven healthcare. This research promises to improve patient care through robust frameworks by providing scalable and effective solutions for analyzing heterogeneous healthcare data, showcasing a comprehensive approach to overcoming obstacles in medical imaging and prediction tasks.
